# Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains projects and exercises developed as part of my Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence certificate program from Berkeley Engineering. Each subfolder represents a distinct project, showcasing practical applications of ML and AI concepts.

## Projects
1. [Will a Customer Accept the Coupon?](https://github.com/salorozco/machine-learning-and-artificial-intelligence/tree/main/customer_coupons)
- Analyzes customer behavior to predict whether they will accept a coupon based on various demographic and behavioral features. The project includes:
- Data Cleaning and Preparation: Addressed missing values, corrected column names, and standardized data for analysis.
- Acceptance Rate Analysis: Over half of the observations (56.84%) chose to accept the coupon, indicating strong interest.
- Category Breakdown: Coffee House and inexpensive restaurant coupons were the most accepted, while Bar and expensive restaurant coupons showed lower acceptance.

This project applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling to derive insights into customer coupon acceptance behavior.
